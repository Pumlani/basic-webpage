  <h2 >Which city? <br><br> <u>Paris</u></h2>
  <img src="eiffel-tower-paris-france-26.jpg" alt="tower picture">
  <P> Often called the City of Lights, Paris is an incredible place to see. Growing from the small village that it used to be on the Seine River into the metropolis that it is today, Paris is the largest city in France and one of the most influential in the world. As the center stage for the French Revolution it became a center of science, arts, fashion, and commerce. In fact, the Paris region accounts for nearly 30% of France’s GDP and it is one of the wealthiest regions in Europe. It is also well known for its museums like the Louvre and Musée d’Orsay. Of course, no visit to Paris would be complete without taking a close up look at the Eiffel Tower, possibly the most famous French icon in the world. Given that France is by far the most visited country on Earth, it would make sense that Paris also sees its fair share of visitors and tourists. Seeming to go on for miles into the horizon, there are truly endless things to see and do in this amazing city.

<div class="six"><h4> Historical places in Cape Town:</h4>

<h5><u>The District Six Museum</u></h5>
<img src="XhxHhPHXMTRdpjoz-croppedURt23-jpg.jpeg" alt="picture of a man">
<p>District Six was named the Sixth Municipal District of Cape Town in 1867. It was established as a mixed community of freed slaves, merchants, artisans, labourers and immigrants,
District Six was a vibrant centre with close links to the city and the port. By the beginning of the twentieth century, however, the process of removals and marginalisation had begun.
The first to be forced out were black South Africans who were displaced from the District in 1901. As the more prosperous moved away to the suburbs, the area became a neglected ward of the city.</p></div>

<div class="church"><h6><u>Church Square</u></h6>
  <img src="Eq6oKt7aZHT5LRXN-croppedGsJVB-jpg.jpeg" alt="picture of a man">
  <p>This area of the city is particularly rich in slave history. On one side stands The Groote Kerk, which gives the square its name. Hundreds of years ago, slaves would wait on the square for their Masters as they attended services at the Groote Kerk. It also includes the Slave Lodge, where thousands of slaves were housed, doubling up, for a time, as one of the Cape’s most well-known brothels. It is a place laden with painful memory, but it is also a place with exciting potential as a lively and engaging public space, one which honours and respects this shared history.</p></div>

  <div class="city"><h7><u>City Hall</u></h7>
    <img src="IMG_20180305_095554.jpg" alt="picture of a man">
  <p>  The Organ was built by Messrs Norman and Beard of London and Norwich, the specifications were drawn up by Sir George Martin, organist of St Paul's Cathedral in London especially for the City Hall. The workmanship and materials are of high quality, and the organ made from mahogany, teak and pine. Sir George Martin spoke of it as “a magnificent instrument in every gradation of tone, from the softest stop to the most powerful tuba being found in the organ, and all under the most perfect control, and that altogether the instrument must be regarded as an artistic and mechanical triumph”.</p></div>
