      <p> The bikes used in this project were donated by Bikes4Humanity and the other distribution costs covered by other donors.BEN’s overall objective is to promote sustainable social and economic empowerment through the use of bicycles. We do this by ensuring a reliable supply of donated and affordable bicycles to disadvantaged communities and institutions. To do this we have to secure an ongoing stream of donated bikes from our donor partners. We distribute these bikes via various projects and through Bicycling Empowerment Centres (BECs), entrepreneur-based businesses that we help to set up in our target communities. We ensure that beneficiaries can maintain their bikes and that they know how to ride safely.BEN also engages with decision makers and stakeholders to ensure that Non-Motorised (NMT) Transport is properly integrated into transport planning.</p>

      <p> With the motto "one man's trash is another man's treasure", this unique centre showcases a 'hands-on', 'outcomes based' practical working example that highlights key issues around sustainable living. The mission of Footprints is the conservation and wise use of resources, as well as the prevention of pollution and waste of these resources for the benefit of people and the planet.

        Footprints is used as a drop-off and recycling centre by the community, but behind that lies a whole experience that should not be missed. Come and experience how recyclables and other items can create sustainable jobs, educate and empower. See how waste is re-used in creative ways to reduce the need for new resources and how 'trash' is converted into beautiful quality arts and crafts at the Waste2Art project.

        The centre is however not limited to waste and you can learn how to reduce your ecological footprint. You can experience how your small actions can reduce energy and water consumption, reduce CO2 emissions and create jobs. Also learn about earthworm composting, indigenous water wise and organic food gardening. The second hand bookshop is always a treasure and there is a small shop selling second hand household items.</p>
